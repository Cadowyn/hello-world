# signigy comments

# snake_case is used for defining. or intializing a method, varible, or file
			
			# Note: WHAT DOES INTIALIZING A METHOD MEAN?
					# Wikipedia: Initializing is the assignment of an initial value for
					# a data object or variable


# Naming a file
this_is_a_snake_cased_file.rb 

# Assigning a variable
forty_two = 42

# Defining a method
def this_is_a_great_method
	# do really awesome stuff with programming
end

			# Note: WHAT IS A METHOD?
			# Wikipedia: A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure
			# associated with a message and an object.

			# Note: WHAT IS A MESSAGE? 
			# Wikipedia: Message passing is a technique for invoking behavior 
			# (i.e., running a program) on a computer. The invoking program sends a 
			# message to a process (which may be an actor or oject) and relies on the
			# process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the actual
			# code to run.  Message passing differs from conventional programming where
			# a process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the 
			# actual code to run.  Message passing differs from conventional
			# programming where a process, subroutine, or function is directly invoked
			# by name. 


# Representing a value that will not change in my program is done by defining a
# constant variable, AKA a constant. In Ruby, constants are denoted with all
# uppercase letters.

# Constant declaration
FOUR = 'four'
FIVE = 'five'

# When working with do/end blocks, prefer {} when the entire code expression fits
# on one line

# Multi-line
[1, 2, 3].each do |i|
	#do awesome stuff
end

# Does the same thing in single line
[1, 2, 3].each { |i| # do awesome stuff } 

# How to declare a class name. When naming my classes I will use CamelCase
# formatting. CamelCase uses no spaces and capitalizes every word.

			# Note: WHAT IS A CLASS NAME?
			# Wikipedia: A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating
			# objects, providing intial values for state (member variables) and 
			# implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

			# When an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting
			# object is called an instance of the class, and the member variables
			# specific to the object are called instance variables, to contrast the
			# class variables shared across the class.
